# Ink-lings: Brand Overview & Messaging

## What Is Ink-lings?

Ink-lings is a **free, web-based journaling prompt delivery service**. Users sign up, choose categories they're interested in, set a notification schedule, and receive thoughtfully crafted journal prompts via email. That's it.

Ink-lings is **not** a journal app. It is not a notes app. It does not store your writing. It is purely a **prompt generator and delivery system**. You write wherever you want -- a physical journal, a notes app, a napkin, or just use the prompt as a dinner conversation starter. Ink-lings delivers the spark; you decide what to do with it.

## Core Mission

**Lower the bar to starting (and keeping) a journaling habit.**

Staring at a blank page is intimidating. Ink-lings removes that friction by telling you *what* to write about. The prompts cover everything from deep personal reflection to silly "what if" scenarios, so there's always something that feels approachable. Regular notifications keep the habit going without requiring willpower.

**You're still leaving your legacy** -- your preferences, your memories, your perspective on life -- you just don't have to figure out where to start.

## Key Brand Messages

### The Elevator Pitch
Ink-lings is a free service that sends you personalized journal prompts on your schedule. Pick your topics, pick your days, and we do the rest. You write wherever you want -- we just give you the spark.

### The "Why It Matters" Pitch
Sometimes it's easier to be told what to write than to stare at a blank page. Ink-lings sends you thoughtful prompts based on topics you care about -- personal reflection, relationships, creativity, gratitude, and more. You don't need a fancy app or a new habit system. Just open the email, grab a pen (or your phone), and start writing. You're capturing who you are, one prompt at a time.

### The Accessibility Pitch
Ink-lings is completely free. No hidden fees, no credit card required, no premium tiers. We believe journaling should be accessible to everyone. Sign up, pick your topics, and start receiving prompts.

### The Habit Pitch
You choose the days and time that work for you. Daily? Three times a week? Just weekends? Ink-lings delivers prompts on your schedule so journaling becomes part of your routine, not another thing to remember.

### The Variety Pitch
With 18 categories and hundreds of prompts, you won't run out of things to write about. If you selected every category and received a prompt every day, you wouldn't see a repeat for 18 years. By then, your answers will have changed anyway.

### The Low Pressure Pitch
There's no right or wrong way to use Ink-lings. Write a paragraph. Write a sentence. Use the prompt as a conversation starter at dinner. Skip a day and come back. There are no streaks to break, no grades, no judgment. Just prompts waiting for you when you're ready.

## The "Ink" Metaphor

The brand leans into ink/writing imagery throughout:
- "Guide the ink"
- "Keeping the ink flowing"
- "Ink flows best when the well doesn't run dry" (donation thank you)
- "Start the ink flowing again" (when restarting paused notifications)
- "Ink-lings" itself -- small drops of ink, small bits of inspiration

---

## Who Is Behind Ink-lings?

Ink-lings is a passion project founded by **Rachell**. It's a solo-built labor of love, not a VC-backed startup. This personal origin story is part of the brand -- emails are signed "Rachell, Founder of Ink-lings" and the cost transparency section shows exactly where money goes.
